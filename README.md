# Complete React & Full-Stack Development Handbook  
**Detailed Table of Contents with Subfolder Projects**

Each subfolder listed below is a **React Vite project** (except where noted) that covers the specific concepts of that module. The projects are designed to be hands-on and incremental, building a strong foundation from prerequisites to full-stack development.

## 🔀 Engineering Workflow & Git Collaboration (Company-Grade)

> Every module's project MUST follow this professional workflow.

### 1. Repository Setup (Fork & Clone)

| Step | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Fork | GitHub UI → "Fork" | Create personal copy |
| Clone | `git clone git@github.com:<you>/fullstack-roadmap.git` | Copy to local |
| Add upstream | `git remote add upstream git@github.com:org/fullstack-roadmap.git` | Track original |
| Verify | `git remote -v` | Confirm remotes |
| Sync main | `git fetch upstream && git checkout main && git merge upstream/main` | Stay updated |

### 2. Branch Strategy

| `chore` | Maintenance | `chore: update .gitignore` |
| `revert` | Revert commit | `revert: feat(auth) ...` |
| `design` | Design assets | `design: add login wireframes` |

### 4. Code Review & Approval

| Step | Actor | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Author | Open PR, assign reviewers |

## 📚 Module 3 — Express.js

> **3.1 → 3.9** are major phases.  
> Each `03-xx` is a sub-module and can be built as a mini-project.  
> Order follows dependency: each step depends on the previous one.  
> Dependency IDs use phase-prefixed form: `3.1-03-01` = Module 3.1 / Sub-module 03-01.
